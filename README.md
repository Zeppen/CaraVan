# CaraVan
CaraVan is an English version of the great repository SmartWoMo made by Kai-Uwe Pielka (http://www.kai-uwe-pielka.de)
Ive added the functionality of using OpenVpn as a client connecting to the service provider NordVPN.
You are now able to swap between IP address between countries just by clicking on shortcuts in the pixel desktop. 
Includes Kodi 17.3 instead of native 15.1

Will add more to this description later on. 
I'm not a coder I mearly just added stuff to the original version of SmartWoMo and translated the German stuff to English. 
The stuff written in German was hard coded. Would be great to be able to set different languages instead but that's no priority of mine.
